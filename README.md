# BookStoreApp
Worked in a group of 3 to develop an online Book Store application. The app was developed to let users buy books and provide administrators access to a customer database where they can view and edit client information, while also letting administrators update and monitor book inventory.

OOP was used to generate book and customer objects, JavaFX was used for the GUI, and the state design pattern was used to modify a customer's member status. This project was written entirely in Java.
